# Deno Box

Deno in a box... on the web.

## TODO (Can't do on a plane w/o internet)

- Sync communication between worker and main (SAB? atomics?)
- Git (Need to drop in isomorphic git in here, that would be great)
- Non-sucky terminal (ask pichu on what to drop in here)
- Non-sucky editor (probably whatever monaco)
- TS Server, modified for deno (really not fun, but doable)
- Nicer sidebar
- Resizable elements
- Website viewer on the right (service workers necessary to capture requests?)?
